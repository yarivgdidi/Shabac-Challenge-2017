# Shabac Challenge 2017

This is my solution to the Shabac challenge of Independence day 2017  
challenge #1 was to compile a broken project - not presented here
challenge #2 was to create a decrypter according to a given key and algorithm - see specific instructions in the read me file. 
in challenge #3 we were asked to brute force a message decrypted by the same algorithm, i.e. we needed to breake the message by guessing the key.
